# VIT Pune : Attendance Monitoring System
The main task is to keep a track of the attendees of our class. Make a platform to ease the task of managing and keeping track of the studentss attending the classes. The database will have several classes and for each class keep a track of contact details of the participants like name, email, etc. and their attendance for each slot. Events can have varying slots based on the duration of the class. On the first webpage, the admin should be able to mark the attendance of the participants according to their time slots. The second webpage will display the final table with the functionality to sort by the number of slots attended.
